Terraria in Minecraft!

The goal is to use as much of Terraria's content to fill out any gaps in Minecraft's gameplay as I can fit. If Minecraft already has a feature from Terraria, or something close enough to it, I won't be adding one just for the sake of completeness. Terraria's Obsidian Brick for example. Minecraft 1.16 just got Blackstone, and it fits so well with the theme of the nether (which is where I'll be adding the Hell biome's content) that I don't really see a need to bring it over.

This is NOT a port. Everything I add has to fit into Minecraft. Walls and Hammers from Terraria will not be added, because Terraria needs them for depth, but Minecraft has a full third dimension to play with. (some walls may get added as decorative blocks though) Platforms need to be passthrough in Terraria for the same reason. 2D means you need to have some way of getting though blocks. But Minecraft you can just walk around obstructions. So platforms are getting reworked to stairs to fill that gap
